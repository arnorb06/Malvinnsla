Abuse penalties questioned
Fines the same for beating a dog in county

By Maria Herne
Tuesday, December 17, 2002
If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a
$100 fine.
If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same
fine.
In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases,
finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either
after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea.
Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court
costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more
than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of
the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found
not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the
matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of
Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases,
the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone
would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.
"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the
penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer
than those in Schuylkill County," Casey said. "What kind of message
are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse
orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because
you'll only get a slap on the wrist?"
Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100;
the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.
Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system
does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey
believes some changes are in order.
Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services,
with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic
violence cases.
She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order
must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.
West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand
for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many
other counties in the state.
"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost,
finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to
mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,"
West said. "It may be difficult for the parties to reach an
agreement so soon after violence has occurred. It's
counter-productive."
The lack of supervised custody visitation in the county - a
neutral, safe, supervised place where children can be exchanged
from one parent to another for the purposes of visitation
- is also a concern.
"Right now we don't have any agency in the county willing to
handle supervised custody visits," West said. "Obviously, in
domestic violence cases this is a major concern to us. There's a
potential for further incidents of abuse to occur during these
meetings without some sort of outside supervision."
Marsha Chwastiak, an attorney in the Pottsville office of
Mid-Penn Legal Services, said she would like to see more funds made
available to provide social services for troubled families
grappling with domestic violence issues.
"If I had one wish for Christmas, it would be to have more
resources available to help these families so they can try and sort
out their problems," Chwastiak said. "In the majority of domestic
violence cases I see, alcohol, drug and mental health problems are
at the heart of the problem. I feel these are more social problems
than legal cases," she said.
Other problems targeted by SWIC include a need for more
expedient service of PFAs; the need for free or affordable legal
representation and assistance with PFA and contempt hearings and
other civil matters related to abuse, including custody and
support; and the lack of proper training by law enforcement
officials in handling domestic violence cases, Casey said.
A recent $202,297 federal grant from the U.S. Department of
Justice Violence Against Women Office may be the answer to some of
these problems.
Through the collaborative efforts of Schuylkill Women In Crisis,
the Schuylkill County Sheriff's Department and county grant writer
Lorraine A. Bennick, the Pathways to Safety program was
initiated.
The two-year program is fully funded under the Justice
Department's "Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement
of Protection Orders" initiative. Some of the ways the funds will
be spent include:
$90,000 to hire a civil justice attorney, at $45,000 a year for
two years, to ensure that all victims of domestic violence are
represented at second hearings in PFAs and assisted with other
civil matters.
$20,171 to support overtime costs of two additional officers to
serve PFAs during nonscheduled work hours, ensuring more expedient
and immediate delivery and service of PFA orders.
$3,645 to develop a domestic violence training program for local
police departments, led by a victim's advocacy trainer; the goal of
these mini-workshops will be to ensure that local police
departments consistently adhere to proper PFA protocol.
$15,000 to hire a consultant to provide a complete, detailed
study of establishing the most cost effective link between county
facilities and municipal police departments and to establish JNET,
an information management system funded by the state of PA and
operated by the Pennsylvania Justice Network.
JNET was launched in 1998 by the Ridge-Schweiker administration
to help local and state police, courts, prisons and probation and
parole officers exchange instantly updated information on
individuals moving through the criminal justice system - making it
possible to better track potentially dangerous individuals.
By helping justice agencies share criminal files more easily,
JNET improves efficiency and reduces potential errors that could
occur from each agency maintaining disparate data files.
JNET is also used to prevent the detention of individuals
wrongly identified as criminal suspects.
"The Pathways to Safety program will compliment existing SWIC
programs and address problems experienced by victims of domestic
violence," Casey said. "We believe that victims of domestic
violence deserve immediate, consistent, respectful treatment and
that offenders receive swift, efficient, just punishment."

Anthem Payout Poses Problem for Some
Poorest Policyholders could lose Medicaid, other Benefits
It might have seemed like manna from heaven - up to thousands of
dollars dropping, often unexpectedly, into the hands of a
half-million Kentucky and Indiana residents this month.
But for some recipients, there is a downside to the checks from
Anthem Inc., issued to policyholders as part of the insurer's
conversion to a publicly traded company.
The poorest recipients could actually suffer from the windfall
by losing their benefits under Medicaid, food-stamp and other
programs. That's because they suddenly have more money than the
eligibility threshold for aid.
TO avoid losing valuable benefits such as a Medicaid-paid spot
in a nursing home, recipients may need to spend their money fast -
as early as the end of this month - but make sure they do it in a
way that meets program guidelines.
"You would think money out of the blue would be a good thing,"
said Jaime Odle Harmon, executive director of the Lexington-based
Access to Justice Foundation. "We're just trying to make sure that
it is, and doesn't have a negative impact on low-income folks and
their families."
Legal aid lawyers in Kentucky have put together an action team
and held frequent statewide conference calls in response to
concerns from aid recipients and advocates that the Anthem payouts
could cost people their benefits, at least temporarily.
"We're getting deluged" with calls on the issue, said Hamon,
whose agency supports the state's legal-services programs and
operates a legal hotline for the elderly.
The basic advice is this: if you received a check or stock from
Anthem and you haven't disposed of it yet, pick up the phone and
call a legal-aid lawyer, benefits counselor or someone else who
understands eligibility guidelines. And do it right away.
"There are people out there who are available to help anyone who
has a problem. It's legal service and it's free," said Amy Turner,
a staff attorney in Louisville with the Legal Aid Society, which
covers Jefferson and 14 surrounding counties.
The sudden concern over losing benefits was triggered by the
recent mailing by Anthem, the Indianapolis-based insurer, of about
$2 billion in checks, plus shares of stock worth a bit more than
that, to 1 million eligible policyholders in four states. About
half of those were individuals or employers in Kentucky and
Indiana.
The distribution was a result of Anthem's conversion last year
from a mutual company, owned by its policyholders, to a publicly
traded company owned by the shareholders.
Despite earlier mailings from Anthem, the checks caught many
people by surprise. And while it was generally a nice surprise, it
worried many aid-recipients who fear losing benefits - especially
elderly residents in Medicaid nursing-home beds.
To qualify for Medicaid and some other state-administered aid
programs in Kentucky, you can't have more than $2000 in liquid
assets on hand. That includes cash and stock. In Indiana, the
Medicaid threshold is even lower, $1500.
The Anthem payouts were large enough to put many seniors over
those limits. The average payout was $4,400, and the largest -
about $22,000 went to people who had been with Anthem the longest,
presumably seniors.
When the checks started showing up in mailboxes sometime after
Christmas, many aid recipients were confused about why they got the
windfall - and what to do with it.
They were justifiably concerned, advocates say.
"I think there's a real danger that people will lose benefits
because they won't understand how to handle this (money)," said
Glenda Harrison, staff attorney with the Northern Kentucky Legal
Aid Society in Covington.
"In particular, the elderly (could) be hurt by this," she said.
"We are concerned that they won't know, one, what this is going to
mean, and then, two, even if they know what it means, won't know
who to contact to help them through this."
Anthem considered the potential effect of its payouts on
public-aid benefits before making its distribution, said
spokeswoman Lauren Green-Caldwell. But after talking to Medicaid
officials in the four states involved, the company concluded "that
we are not in a position to provide advice to these people," she
said.
She said the company believes the distribution has "been a
really good thing" and was handled fairly.
While people wondering how to handle their payout should consult
an expert abou their particular situation, there are some general
guidelines.
"You can't give it away, said Jess Williams, branch manager for
eligibility policy for Kentucky Department for Medicaid Services.
He said many people are asking if they can give it to their
children to put it in a trust for them. The answer is no.
In general, you must receive fair-market value for whatever you
spend it on. That means for example, "You can't pay your son
$10,000 for a car that is worth $2000," said Lee Richardson, a
Louisville attorney specializing in elder law.
The good news, for those who must spend up to $22,000 in a few
days, is that there is a fairly broad latitude in what you can
spend the money on. Kentucky advocates and Medicaid officials
suggest such alternatives as buying a prepaid burial, paying
premiums in advance on Medicare supplement health-insurance policy
or paying outstanding medical bills. Other allowable expenditures
could include buying a car for medical transportation needs, making
home repairs or paying property taxes.
The main requirement is, you must get value for your money.
Otherwise, when you report spending to Medicaid - as is required -
official could treat the money as unspent, which could affect your
benefits.
In Indiana, similarly, "there isn't really any particular
restriction on what you can buy with your money . . .as long as you
spend the money," said Christopher Holly, a paralegal with Indian
Legal Services' Bloomington office.

Law school debts forcing recruits to private sector
November 18, 2002
WASHINGTON (AP) - Most new lawyers won't consider working for
government or public advocacy groups because their need for money
to pay off massive student loans leads them to the more lucrative
private sector, a study being released Monday found.
Legal education debt, which tops $84,000 for the average new
lawyer, prevents 66 percent of law students from taking public
interest jobs, according to the joint study by Equal Justice Works,
the National Association for Law Placement and the Partnership for
Public Service. The Washingtonbased groups promote public interest
work.
"The bottom line is America's law school graduates are drowning
in debt and shut out of public service at a time when the federal
government is facing losses of over half its work force due to
retirements," said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the
Partnership for Public Service.
More than 94 percent of law students reported borrowing money to
attend law school, where median tuition is nearly $23,000 a year,
but law students are not alone in having to contend with spiraling
education costs.
The need to pay off student loans discourages doctors from going
to rural communities or inner-city hospitals. A chronic teacher
shortage has led some states to consider ways to help
teaching-educa-tion students pay off college debts.
The student loan agency Nellie Mae says the average college
graduate's student-loan debt has reached at least $19,400. In
addition, figures for 2000 showed that graduates had average credit
card debt of around $2,750.
In the law study, about 68 percent of public interest employers
surveyed - government offices, legal aid organizations, public
defenders and other nonprofit groups - reported recruiting
difficulties. Most blamed the combination of low starting salaries
and high law school loans for discouraging law students from public
service jobs.
The report encourages law schools and employers to create
programs to help students who choose public service pay back loans
in their lower-paying jobs. A few schools, including Harvard, New
York and Georgetown universities, already have them.
The median starting salary last year at private law firms, was
$90,000. By contrast, public interest groups pay new graduates
about $35,000, while government pays $40,000 to $45,000.








A Comparison of the Burden of Universal Service in Italy

1. INTRODUCTION
Samuel Johnson said Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
and many postal observers believe that the Universal Service
Obligation (USO) is the last refuge of a postal service wishing to
protect inefficiency, monopoly profits, or economic rents. Despite
inefficient service, opaque accounts, and large rents, many postal
officials maintain that the monopoly, whatever its faults, is the
only means of ensuring universal, affordable postal service for
citizens throughout the nation. Without the monopoly, they argue,
the post office would be crushed by the cost of the USO. This paper
examines when this argument might be valid.
All posts probably have some cost associated with the USO, but
it has been difficult to quantify. We agree with John Panzar (2001)
that the cost of the USO is the cost of the services that would not
be provided in a competitive market. Under this definition, in
practice, there has been no discernable USO cost. Competition
exists in both Sweden and New Zealand and the incumbent posts have
continued to provide universal service with no subsidy.
The USO as defined by the proponents of the monopoly goes well
beyond ubiquitous service. It also includes a uniform price with
respect to location of the recipient1 and a uniform frequency of
delivery. These conditions might have been appropriate a century
ago when the post was the primary means of communication. Today
however, this definition seems unduly restrictive. It is incumbent
on defenders of the restrictive definition of USO to explain why
postal service should be treated
*
The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and
do not necessarily represent the opinions of Poste Italiane or the
Postal Rate Commission.
In other words a firm cannot charge more for delivering similar
items to addresses in one section of the country than another.
Under this definition United Parcel Service (UPS) is not a true
universal service provider because it imposes a surcharge for
residential delivery. This is ironic because UPS delivers to every
address in the continental U.S. and delivers right to the door. The
Postal Service which is a universal service provider under the
definition used here, delivers to mail boxes that are, in many
cases, remote from the actual address.
differently from other important products such as groceries,
bank accounts and internet service.2 Notwithstanding, we use this
restrictive definition of universal service for this paper.
The obligation to provide ubiquitous service is not in itself
onerous. It has been pointed out by the American co-authors of this
paper that a post could rationalize its delivery costs by reducing
the frequency of service on unprofitable routes to the point where
they become profitable (Cohen et al. 2000). A post could also
rationalize its prices by reflecting the cost of service to
different areas. The restrictive definition of the USO does not
allow a post to rationalize either its cost or pricing structure,3
thus, creating cream-skimming opportunities under liberalization.
The burden that the restrictive USO imposes on a post is the
increase in its unit costs resulting from cream skimming under
liberalization caused by the requirements of uniform pricing and
levels of service. We use the term "burden of the USO" to
distinguish our concept from other papers that use the term "cost
of the USO."
We believe that insights into the burden of the USO can be
gained by comparing postal systems. Assuming that the keenest
insights can be gained by comparing systems with large differences,
the Italian and United States systems are good candidates. The
U.S. has the highest volume per capita in the industrial world
(739 pieces in 1999), while Italy has one of the lowest (115 pieces
in 1999).4
Previous work by Cohen et al. shows that the U.S. Postal Service
(USPS) is not likely to require the monopoly to continue to satisfy
the USO. (Cohen 1999, 2000) However, this result may not apply to
all posts and it is important to distinguish magnitudes of burden
for different posts. To this end, we develop a model to determine
the USO burden for posts with different per capita volumes. In
particular, applying the model demonstrates that the burden of USO
is very great for Poste Italiane and other posts with small per
capita volumes. On the other hand, for the U.S. and other posts
with large and medium per capita volumes the burden is small.
We first compare some statistics for Italy and the U.S. We then
examine the consequences of volume loss on postal systems in order
to provide a measure of burden in terms of increases in average
unit costs as volume is lost to competitors, or
2
Many postal services are increasingly becoming primarily
carriers of advertising. U.S. households receive far more
advertising than letters, bills or other similar matter. According
to the Household Diary Study (United States Postal Service 2000),
in 1999, 56 percent of the pieces received by U.S. households were
advertising mail.
3
An apparent exception is Consignia. It rationalizes its delivery
cost by delivering twice a day in most urban areas and once a day
in rural areas.
4
Italy has a very undeveloped direct mail market and the Italian
monopoly does not include direct mail. The
U.S. monopoly includes all addressed direct mail consisting of
fewer than 24 pages. The U.S. Postal Service handled 314 pieces per
capita of direct mail in 1999.
equivalently, the increase in average rates for the volume
remaining.5 Next we introduce the concept of delivery route profit
and quantify the relative profits from delivered mail and mail not
requiring delivery in both Italy and the U.S. We then compare the
distribution of profit margins for routes in Italy and the U.S. and
the effect this has on vulnerability to cream skimming. Finally, we
discuss two measures of the cost of universal service, the entry
pricing measure and the net avoided cost measure in the context of
delivery profits. We compare them with our burden measure for the
Poste Italiane and the U.S. Postal Service.
Our principal findings are:
The burden of the USO is much greater for small per capita
volume posts than it is for large and medium per capita volume
posts.
The likelihood of a graveyard spiral resulting from volume loss
to cream skimmers is remote for medium to large volume per capita
posts; whereas it is a real threat to small volume per capita
posts.
The measure of burden presented here combined with the
distribution of route profit margins for Poste Italiane and the
U.S. Postal Service yields results contrary to the entry price and
net avoided cost measures for the cost of the USO.
The portion of mail not requiring delivery is a very important
contributor to the finances of a post.


2. COMPARATIVE STATISTICS
Table 1 contains some statistics for Italy and the U.S. and for
their postal administrations.6 Italy has 21 percent of the U.S.
population and 16 percent (approximately one seventh) of the U.S.
per capita volume. Most of the delivery statistics in the table's
second section are reasonably close to this 16 percent figure. The
number of delivery points in Italy, as a percentage of those in the
U.S., is a
5
To provide a basis for comparing Poste Italiane and the U.S.
Postal Service, we use a model of postal operations that follows
the structure of FY 1999 costs in the U.S. Postal Service.
Parametric analyses are conducted by varying volume under different
assumptions about the extent that institutional cost varies over
the long run. The model is validated for Poste Italiane by making
adjustments for major differences in the two posts, such as the
extent of worksharing.
6
Prices of goods and services vary between Italy and the United
States, and the prevailing market exchange rate does not
necessarily account for the relative differences in prices. We have
used the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of 1,677 liras per U.S.
dollar to convert the 1999 Italian statistics reported in Italian
liras. The PPP has been produced by the Organization of Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and shows the number of Italian
liras required in 1999 to buy goods and services equivalent to what
can be purchased with one U.S. dollar. In 1999, the average market
exchange rate, reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
was 1,817 liras per
U.S. dollar.
disproportionately high 25 percent. The disproportionate number
of small business addresses in Italy (Scarfiglieri and Visco
Comandini 2001) may help explain this.
Poste Italiane also has disproportionately more delivery points
per route. This results from a much lower coverage (percent of
addresses receiving mail on a given day), a higher population
density and other unexplored route and topographical
considerations.7 We see in the fourth section that the U.S. Postal
Service cost per piece is much lower than Poste Italiane cost per
piece despite having a much higher labor cost per employee. This is
primarily a result of economies of scale, worksharing and the
extensive use of automation.8

also illustrates that the concept of the USO has many more
dimensions than ubiquitous delivery. However, the cross-subsidy
that results from ubiquitous delivery and uniform prices and
frequency of delivery is widely regarded as the most important
aspect of the USO mitigating against liberalization. This paper
will be restricted to dealing with this aspect.

It is also the result of the quantity of non-delivered mail (See
Section 4).


3. RELATIVE IMPACT OF VOLUME LOSS ON POSTAL SYSTEMS
The burden of the USO on a postal system lies within its fixed
costs. Ceteris paribus, unit (per piece) fixed costs are higher in
a low volume per capita system than in a high volume per capita
system. We examine the effect of volume on unit total costs.
The sensitivity of cost to volume for a postal system can be
investigated directly provided the ratio of fixed to variable costs
is known by function. Some postal administrations do not have this
information and some choose not to make it available to regulators
or the public. Consequently, we have built a model to estimate the
relationship between unit average costs and per capita volume. 9
The model is described in the appendix and includes parameters for
the portion of variable costs by major postal functions. When the
average unit cost is graphed as a function of volume per capita one
obtains a curve with a parabolic shape. The exact shape of the
curve depends on the specific set of parameters used to benchmark
the model, such as the proportion of fixed costs at a specific per
capita volume. Because the cost behavior of the U.S. Postal Service
has been studied extensively and because U.S. postal costs are the
most transparent in the industrialized world, we use U.S data from
1999 as provided in the most recent omnibus rate proceeding, Docket
No. R2000-1 to benchmark the model10 Table 2 shows the U.S.
institutional/variable percentages for the major postal
functions.
Table 2 : U.S. Fixed/Variable Cost By Major Function a (FY
1999)

Source: Postal Rate Commission Docket No. R2000-1
b
Delivery includes in-office and out-of-office costs.
Because the U.S. Postal Service may differ greatly from other
postal systems in labor cost, automation, route topography,
worksharing, mix of mail by shape, and the percentage of
non-delivered mail, etc., we cannot expect the cost estimates
furnished by the model to be extremely accurate estimates of
particular non-U.S. systems. For our
9
We use pieces per capita rather than total volume to normalize
the volume.
10
This model has been developed on the assumption that the cost
behavior of postal administrations is essentially similar. The
functions of collection, delivery, transportation, processing and
window services are common to the postal administrations of all
industrialized countries.
purposes we do not need great accuracy, we only need reasonable
estimates in order to examine the sensitivity of total unit cost to
volume per capita.
The fixed portion of non-delivery costs would be expected to
change as we move from higher volume administrations to lower
volume ones. It would be expected that lower volume postal
administrations would try to keep them small to reduce the burden
on rate payers. Since these costs are variable in the long run and
we do not know how other postal administrations deal with them, we
parameterize them for purposes of modeling.
As a preliminary matter, using the fixed/variable ratios for
U.S. Postal Service costs from Table 2, Figure 1 shows that as per
capita volume increases, the mail processing proportion of total
cost will increase and the delivery proportion will decrease. This
is because mail-processing costs are almost all variable while
delivery costs have a very large fixed component. Since the U.S.
volume per capita is the highest in the world, the U.S. Postal
Service delivery costs proportion should be the smallest of any
postal service. On the other hand, Poste Italiane per capita volume
is among the lowest in the industrialized world, and so its
delivery costs proportion should be among the highest.

Pieces per Capita
Again using the ratios for U.S. Postal Service costs in Table 2,
Figure 2 shows the variability of the major functions as per capita
volume changes. It can be seen that at low volumes, mail processing
and transportation costs have a high degree of fixity while at high
volumes they are almost all variable.

Figure 3 shows the impact of per capita volume on average unit
costs. The three curves represent different variabilities of
non-delivery fixed costs as shown in the legend. It appears that
unit costs are not very sensitive to changes in per capita volume
at the high end but are quite sensitive at the low end. For
example, a ten-percent reduction in pieces per capita for the U.S.
Postal Service would result in costs increasing about one cent. A
ten-percent reduction for a post at 100 pieces per capita would
increase unit costs by nine cents. The increase in unit cost
resulting from a ten-percent decrease in per capita volume for a
range of volumes is shown in Table 3.
Figure 3: Model Estimates of Unit Cos
Benchmarked by U.S. Costs and Volumes

Pieces per Capita Long-Run Variability of Non-Delivery
Institutional Costs

In the per capita volume range of most Northern European
countries, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, the effect on unit
cost from a ten-percent reduction in per capita volume is not
great. At about 200 pieces per capita the effect of volume loss on
unit cost becomes much more pronounced.11
Table 3: Unit Cost with 10% Decrease in Volume Assuming 25% of
Non-Delivery Institutional Costs are Long-Run Variable
(1999 U.S. Dollars)
Pieces per Capita 700 600 500 400 300 200 100
Base unit cost 0.32 0.33 0.36 0.40 0.46 0.59 0.97 Unit cost with
10% volume loss 0.33 0.35 0.38 0.42 0.49 0.63 1.06
When volume is lost to cream skimmers because of the USO, net
revenue losses (revenue minus cost) must be made up from the
remaining volume to maintain breakeven status. The burden measure
quantifies the resulting increase in unit cost and revenue that
must be made up from each piece of mail that remains in the system.
An important question is whether the rate increases would lead to a
graveyard spiral. We think the burden measure provides an answer to
this question.
Insofar as the burden of the USO might introduce a death spiral
(Crew and Kleindorfer 2000) owing to the loss of volume because of
liberalization, the probability seems slight until per capita
volumes are in the 100 to 150-piece range. Below that point the
possibility of a death spiral increases rapidly. Thus, we conclude
that the burden of the USO is much greater for low per capita
volume posts than for medium to high volume ones.
In order to make the model more useful for comparing Poste
Italiane and the U.S. Postal Service we adjust model costs to
account for important known differences. Since worksharing
activities reduce United States costs by about 25 percent (Cohen et
al. 2001), we increase model costs to account for the lack of
worksharing in Italy. The portion of the model costs that are labor
costs is adjusted downwards to reflect hourly labor cost
differences between Poste Italiane and the U.S. Postal Service. In
addition, model costs are adjusted to reflect the Poste Italiane
proportion of low-cost letters (and cards), medium-cost flats, and
high-cost parcels. The appendix describes the adjustment factors.
Table 4 shows estimates of Poste Italiane unit costs derived using
the model.
It can be seen that the model comes fairly close to Poste
Italiane unit costs. Of course the model could be further refined
to account for many more specific differences. We leave that
project for another day. Nonetheless, we think the model is
sufficiently accurate to allow us to draw a major conclusion: the
burden of universal service is highly dependent on volume per
capita, so policies suitable for liberalizing medium and large per
capita volume posts are likely not suitable for small per capita
volume posts.
Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain have per capita volumes below
200.

4. PROFITS FROM DELIVERED AND NON-DELIVERED MAIL
Because of the interest in the USO and cross-subsidy within the
delivery system, it is important to define the concept of route
profit (and loss). We define the profitability of a delivery route
as the revenue generated by the mail delivered on the route minus
the attributable upstream costs of the mail delivered and the total
cost of the route (Cohen et al. 1999). Some mail handled by a
postal service does not require delivery; recipients pick up mail
from post office boxes and large volume recipients pick up mail in
bulk from designated counters.12 Non-delivered mail can also be
considered to have delivery profits in the same manner as delivered
mail.13
A postal service has variable and fixed upstream costs as well
as variable and fixed delivery costs. In a breakeven postal service
total delivery profits from all routes plus profits from
non-delivered mail must equal fixed upstream costs.14 Put another
way, fixed upstream costs minus profits from non-delivered mail
must equal delivery profits.
In order to compare profits from delivered and non-delivered
mail in Italy and the
U.S. we increase Poste Italiane revenue by 24 percent so that it
equals cost and is thus at breakeven.15 Table 5 shows that
non-delivered mail accounts for a very disproportionate share of
delivery profits in both posts (and presumably in all posts). The
most obvious reason for this is that non-delivered mail incurs no
carrier delivery cost. In addition, although many delivery routes
are highly profitable, losses from unprofitable routes reduce the
net delivery profit from delivered mail.
12
In the United States, this is frequently called "firm holdout"
mail.
13
Revenue minus attributable upstream costs that includes the
small amount of costs for non-carrier box or counter delivery
activities associated with non-delivered mail.
14
An analogous identity holds for a post at any given profit
(loss).
15
Data in this paper are from 1999. In that year, the U.S. Postal
Service had profits of $400 million and total revenue of $62.8
billion.

Table 5: Distribution of Volume and Profits between
Delivered and Non-delivered Mail
(Percent)
Italy U.S. Volume Profits Volume Profits
Delivered 8658 79 33 Non-delivered 1442 21 67
Because total delivery profits from delivered and non-delivered
mail must equal fixed upstream costs, non-delivered mail plays an
important role in reducing the revenue needs of a breakeven post.
Ceteris paribus, the higher the proportion of non-delivered mail,
the lower the rates that a breakeven post must charge. Thus, the
higher the proportion of non-delivered mail, the less opportunity
there is for a cream skimmer to undercut the incumbent.16,17
Moreover highly profitable non-delivered mail is much less
vulnerable to diversion.18
5. DISTRIBUTION OF ROUTE PROFIT MARGINS AND VULNERABILITY TO
CREAM SKIMMING
Volumes, revenues and route profits differ widely on routes in
both Italy and the
U.S. The uniform pricing constraint of the USO creates cream
skimming possibilities because an entrant can target only highly
profitable routes and charge a price below the uniform price.
Consequently, it is not cross-subsidy per se that allows cream
skimming. All routes could be above incremental cost and the
problem would still exist. Cream skimming stems from the uniform
pricing and service constraints given that routes have disparate
profits, and not necessarily from the need to cross-subsidize
routes.
16
We would expect that the USPS's percentage of non-delivered mail
to be among the highest of industrialized country posts because the
U.S. payment system involves a large fraction of financial
transactions paid by check and mailed to large volume recipients.
This mail is generally picked up by them (or their agents) at a
post office (i.e., it is non-delivered mail).
17
In a small per capita volume post, the fixed cost of delivery
represents a larger share of total cost than in a large per capita
volume post. Ceteris paribus, per piece profit from non-delivered
mail is greater in a small per capita volume post than in a large
one.
18
Many of the 18 million boxholders in the United States do not
want mail delivered to their premises. We cannot quantify the
number, but presumably, this is an important reason why mail
recipients rent a post office box. These box holders would not be
good candidates for cream skimmers. Fifty-six percent of
non-delivered mail is single piece. It is not likely that cream
skimmers would be able to successfully put a collection system in
place to capture much of this mail. Of the 44 percent of
non-delivered mail that remains, 36 percent is First Class, much of
which is time sensitive. According to most models of cream
skimming, delivery frequency would be reduced. Time sensitive First
Class would be less likely to make use of a service with less
frequent delivery. Finally, non-single piece mail addressed to box
holders is being transported and delivered over large areas of the
nation. A delivery cream skimmer would have to have a national
presence to compete for this mail. This means much of the mail
could not be handled by local niche players or even regional cream
skimmers.
The more revenue that leaves the system because of cream
skimming, the more rates must be increased on the remaining mail to
maintain a breakeven status. Consequently, the greater the share of
system-wide revenue that is from high margin routes, the greater
impact that cream skimming could have on a postal administration.
In order to compare the possible effect of cream skimming on the
Italian and U.S. postal administrations, we have arrayed their
routes by profit margin using FY 1999 data. Again, we have adjusted
the Poste Italiane revenue to breakeven in order to facilitate
comparison.
Figure 4 displays the profit margin19 of routes arrayed by
semi-deciles. The most profitable Italian semi-decile has a margin
of just over 30 percent while the most profitable U.S. semi-decile
has a margin of over 50 percent. However, a greater percentage of
Italian routes are profitable than U.S. routes.
We do not know the profit margin that would actually attract
cream skimmers. If it is 30 percent, then 10 percent of U.S. routes
would be vulnerable and less than 7 percent of Italian routes would
be vulnerable.
Virtually all profitable routes in Italy are urban. In the U.S.,
only about half of the routes served by city carriers are
profitable while three quarters of the routes served by rural
carriers are profitable.20 It may well be that competition is much
more likely to develop in urban areas. If so, Poste Italiane would
be at greater risk from cream skimmers than the U.S. Postal
Service.
19
For purposes of this discussion, profit margin is defined as the
ratio of delivery profits to route costs (i.e. upstream variable
plus total delivery cost).
20
In the U.S. about one fifth of the routes served by rural
carriers are in high-density suburban areas.

Semi-decile (Routes by 5% Increments)
a
Revenue for Poste Italiane is increased by 24% to create
breakeven conditions.
The percent of total revenue by semi-decile is shown in Table 6.
At every semidecile except the first, Poste Italiane receives a
greater percentage of total revenue than the U.S. Postal Service.
This is due to the fact that a much larger percentage of U.S.
revenue comes from undelivered mail.
The distribution of profitable routes shown on Figure 4
indicates that the U.S. Postal Service's revenue (volume) per route
is much more skewed than Poste Italiane's, as measured by the
relative size of the bars at the extremes. This would tend to make
the
U.S. Postal Service more attractive to cream skimmers than Poste
Italiane (at most profit thresholds). This skewness results from
mail volume being highly correlated with income and U.S. income
distribution being much more skewed than Italian income
distribution. (Berthelemy and Toledano 2000; Kolin and Smith 1999)
In fact the U.S. has the most skewed income distribution of any
industrialized country as measured by the World Bank's Gini Index.
The U.S. Gini Index is 40.8 while Italy's is 27.3.21 Thus, Italy
should be fairly typical of the distribution of route profit
margins of industrial countries and the U.S. should be an
outlier.
"World Development Indicators 2001, Table 2.8" The World Bank,
Washington, DC. The unweighted average of Gini Indices for
industrialized countries is 30.6. Austria has the lowest index at
23.1.

Because volume and revenue are highly correlated, if volume is
lost to cream skimming, then revenue is also lost. Figure 4 and
Table 6 can be used to estimate likely profit and revenue losses to
cream skimmers and Figure 3 to estimate the cost impact of volume
losses. Depending on the threshold selected, the potential impact
on the respective posts can be compared.
We doubt that cream skimmers could capture even a majority of
the volume on any route owing to the limited amount of contestable
volume in the U.S. and perhaps other countries.22 Nevertheless, to
the extent that volume would be lost to cream skimmers, the impact
on Poste Italiane would be greater than on the U.S. Postal
Service.
As mentioned above, the Italian data have been adjusted for
breakeven. Had we not done this, very few Italian routes would be
profitable. A postal service that is below breakeven will be less
attractive to cream skimmers than otherwise. On the other hand, if
a postal service is above breakeven, its routes will be even more
profitable and hence, more attractive to cream skimmers.



6. ENTRY PRICING
The entry pricing measure defines the cost of the USO as the sum
of lost profits from entry by a competitor. The form of entry that
we consider is delivery cream skimming. If an entrant were more
efficient than the incumbent, then the USO would not cause the lost
profit. Under the restrictive definition of the USO, however, it is
possible for the incumbent post to be more efficient than the
entrant and still lose profits because the incumbent must charge a
uniform price. The entrant would most likely attack routes with
much higher than average profit margins. The incumbent would not be
able to
Cohen et al. (2000) found that less than 16 percent of total
U.S. Postal Service volume is contestable.
respond because of the restrictive USO. Ceteris paribus, the
more skewed the incumbent's route profit margin distribution, the
more vulnerable the post is to entry.23
Figure 4 shows that the Poste Italiane profit margin
distribution is much less skewed than the U.S. Postal Service's
distribution. Thus, according to the entry price measure the cost
of the USO is higher in the U.S. than in Italy.24 This is contrary
to the conclusion that we have drawn in Section 3 (i.e., that the
burden of the USO is much higher for Poste Italiane than for the
U.S. Postal Service).
The possibility of an equal or less efficient entrant capturing
significant volume depends on the fraction of mail on profitable
routes that is actually contestable. Given the huge scale economies
of a universal service provider and the limited amount of
contestable mail, it is very difficult for an entrant, at least in
the U.S., to charge prices lower than an incumbent (Cohen et al.
1999).


7. NET AVOIDED COST
The net avoided cost measure (NAC) of the USO is the sum of the
losses from unprofitable routes (Dobbs and Golay 1995; Elsenblast
and Stumpf 1995). As stated earlier, the profits from delivered and
non-delivered mail must equal the upstream fixed cost in a
breakeven post. If the profits from the money making routes and
non-delivered mail exceed the upstream fixed cost, then there must
be an offset of money losing routes. This is simply an accounting
identity. The more skewed the distribution of delivery route profit
margins, the greater will be the losses from unprofitable routes.
Figure 4 shows that the NAC would be greater for the U.S. Postal
Service than for Poste Italiane (assuming adjustments for scale).
Again, this is contrary to our finding in Section 3 about the
relative burden of the USO.
Furthermore, we believe that the logic of the NAC measure is
flawed. Suppose that a government decides to provide a subsidy to
its breakeven postal service to offset losses on unprofitable
routes because it wishes taxpayers and not rate payers to fund the
USO. The postal service would then have a surplus. In order for the
postal service to return to breakeven, prices would be reduced. 25
Because of the price reduction unprofitable routes would become
even more unprofitable and some formerly profitable routes would
become unprofitable. Because the total losses from unprofitable
routes are greater than before, the government would have to
increase its subsidy.
23
For purposes of the discussion of entry pricing and net avoided
cost, we ignore the impact of the percentage of non-delivered
mail.
24
Bradley and Colvin (2000) estimated the entry pricing cost of
the USO for the United States. That estimate assumed that the
entrant would capture all volume on all profitable routes. It is a
worst case scenerio.
25
The same logic would hold for a postal service earning any given
profit (loss).
This process would continue until there is but one route not
subsidized by the government and that route would be the route that
initially was the most profitable one in the system. Thus, the net
avoided cost measure implies the absurdity that a government must
fund the entire delivery network if it wants to fund the cost of
universal service.


8. CONCLUSION
We introduce and quantify the concept of the burden of the USO,
which is the upward impact on unit costs that would result from
competitive entry. We find that the burden on low per capita postal
systems is much greater than on medium to high volume postal
systems. This is contrary to results obtained when using the net
avoided cost or entry pricing measures of the cost of the USO. We
also find that the burden decreases as the percentage of
non-delivered mail increases. The distribution of route profits is
much more skewed for the U.S. Postal Service than for Poste
Italiane. This would tend to make the U.S. more attractive to
potential cream skimmers. On the other hand, a greater percentage
of Poste Italiane revenue is generated by delivered mail, and this
would cause cream skimming to have a greater impact on its unit
costs.
APPENDIX
Model Definition.
The model is designed to define average unit cost as a function
of volume (Q), based on the USPS cost structure for FY 1999.
AC = TC / (Q * P)
where:
TC = DC + NDC
DC = (Vd / Q0) Q + Fd
NDC = (Vnd / Q0) Q + [ (Ev Fnd) / Q0 ] Q + (1 - Ev) Fnd
The functions can be combined and expressed as:
TC = { [ V + (Ev Fnd) ] / Q0 } Q + Fd + (1 - Ev) Fnd
The terms are defined as:
AC = Average Unit Cost d = Subscript that indicates delivery
component of a cost or volume DC = Total Delivery Cost Ev =
Long-run variability of non-delivery institutional (fixed)
costs.

Adjustments for differences between the USPS and Poste
Italiane
Significant differences in the composition of mail and labor
costs exist between USPS and Poste Italiane. To make the comparison
of the unit cost from our model (which is based on USPS cost data)
and the actual unit cost of Poste Italiane more meaningful, we
apply three factors to the results of our model. The unit cost
assuming 25% of institutional (fixed) costs vary with volume in the
long run is calculated in the example.



1.
First, the attributable (variable) cost from the model
(V/Q0*P = $0.194) is adjusted to reflect the different shape mix of
mail handled by Poste Italiane. The proportions of letters (88%)
and nonletters (12%) for Poste Italiane are applied to the USPS
variable unit cost of each (13.46 and 26.60 cents, respectively).
The weighted average unit cost that results (15.04 cents) is then
divided by the actual USPS unit variable unit cost of 16.88 cents.
The resulting ratio (0.891) is applied to the variable cost from
the model.

Example: 0.194 * 0.891 = $0.173



2.
Next, the resulting variable cost is adjusted to account
for the savings from worksharing reflected in the USPS costs, which
do not exist for Poste Italiane. The USPS variable costs in FY 1999
were 40% lower than they would have been without worksharing,
(Cohen et al. 2001) so the variable cost from step one ($0.173) is
increased by that amount.

Example: $0.173 * 1.4 = $0.242


3.
Finally, both variable and institutional costs are
adjusted for labor cost differences. Since 78.6% of USPS costs are
labor costs, that portion of the variable cost from step two
($0.242) and institutional cost from the model ($0.662) is adjusted
by the ratio of Poste Italiane labor costs to those of USPS
(74.7%).


Example: [ (0.786) ($0.242 + $0.662) (0.747) ] + [ (1 - 0.786)
($0.242 + $0.662) ] = $0.724

Bailando con el Diablo (Dancing with the Devil)
A popularly narrated legend found throughout the Southwest, south Texas, and even parts of northern Mexico that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances, dance halls, and discotheques. Called the “devil at the dance” legend or “devil haunts the dance hall” in folklore literature, it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations. The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed, usually in a suit; he is strikingly handsome, muy suave (smooth and poised), tall, and refined. Consequently, he stands out from among the rest of the men. Besides his stunning appearance, he is always an amazing dancer, knows the latest dance steps, and selects the prettiest girl to dance.
As the tale is often narrated, a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents’ permission, or she goes against her mother’s express wishes. While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance. They dance all night, until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isn’t wearing shoes, and in fact he doesn’t even have feet; instead he has chicken feet, goat’s hooves, or a pig’s foot and a chicken foot. It is usually at this point, after he’s discovered, that he disappears into thin air, leaving the odor of sulfur in the air, or, in some versions of the legend, just runs out the door. The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke. If the girl doesn’t die, as in some stories, she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man’s handprint might be found on her back. A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter, and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there.
The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one’s parents, for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil. It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends, among themselves or from mothers to daughters, in a didactic fashion, to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority. In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday, a religious holy day, and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households. The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous sign.
Robe’s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico, collected in the 1950s and 1960s, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s. Limón and Herrera-Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people.
Of course, not everyone believes such stories. Martin’s book contains a story by a man born in 1904, who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by coming to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, “The Devil! The Devil!” The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick, so he doesn’t believe in the legend (50).

Baile (Dance)
El baile is an individual dance step, a party, or a ball. El baile is historically one of the most important social traditions among Mexicans and Chicanos throughout Mexico and the United States. Since the Spaniards conquered the Southwest, bailes have been important community social and cultural events. In Texas, New Mexico, and California, because of the isolation of the communities, dancing became the principal source of entertainment. The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered, with their primary social venues consisting of church and home. El baile provided entertainment and physical activity. As an early California traveler put it, “I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out, night after night, in dancing, of which they never seemed to weary, but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising” (Shay 100). It was at el baile that courtship occurred (since girls, although they may have gone to the dance chaperoned, were allowed to dance with boys); it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted, that the week’s work was forgotten, and that life’s mysteries were discussed. The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes. A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy, because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition, and could be cause for revenge. Countless corridos (ballads), leyendas (legends), and chistes (jokes) narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile, from fights to courtships to elopements. Encounters with the legendary weeping woman, La Llorona, often occur after a dance when a solitary man is finding his way home. From the devil-at-the-dance narratives to the tragic death of Rosita Alvarez, recounted in the corrido of the same name, we learn of the importance of el baile in both rural and urban Chicano communities. Major Horace Bell describes the difference between a baile and a fandango in Mexican California history and Arnoldo De Leon describes the baile in eighteenth-century San Antonio.
Most Mexican national holiday celebrations such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre will end with a community dance. Even in modern times, professional Latino and Chicano associations often close their national conferences with a baile, bringing in popular Chicano bands. Jose Limón discusses the narratives of bailando con el diablo (dancing with the devil), and Manuel Peña shows us the ritualized structure of a Chicano dance.

Ballet Folklórico
The term refers to folk dance groups, grupos folklóricos, that perform traditional Mexican regional dances. The dances are carefully choreographed and well rehearsed; they are representative of the dances from the different regions of Mexico. An important characteristic of the dance performances is the elaborate beautiful costumes, very full and colorful dresses, that are the traditional dress from the various states of Mexico, such as Jalisco, Veracruz, Chihuahua, and Durango. The dances, many of which have been danced for decades, such as El Jarabe Tapatio and La Negra, are danced to Mariachi music, and performed on the Mexican national holidays, Las Fiestas Patrias, such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre.
These folk dance groups became popular in Mexico right after the Mexican Revolution, but did not become prevalent in the United States until the 1960s. It was the influence of the Chicano civil rights movement, el movimiento Chicano, that launched the institution of ballets folklóricos as symbolic of a Mexican American cultural identity. El Ballet Folklórico de Mexico, founded and directed by Amalia Hernandez in the early 1950s, became the official cultural representative of the Mexican government and has often toured the United States. Amalia Hernandez based her folklore costumes and folk dances on the authentic folklore traditions of the Mexican people. This folklórico group became the model on which most Chicano folklórico groups are based.
Mexican folklore traditions, folk songs, and folk dances had been taught within Mexican colonias (neighborhoods), today known as barrios, since before the 1930s, usually through the efforts of a single individual in the community, in church halls and mutual aid society halls, but not in the public schools. There was one exception: in Tucson, Arizona, a teacher named Margarite Collier started a Mexican Folklore Club in 1937 in an elementary school, for the specific purpose of maintaining the cultural traditions from Mexico. This club existed until the 1970s, and it established a long tradition of performing Las Posadas through the streets of Tucson. Madelyn Loes Soloman documents that in Los Angeles the teaching of folk songs and dances was done by a Mexican-born man in the late 1930s. But it was in the late 1960s and 1970s that there was a revival in the formal organization of elaborate performances by large dance groups, many made up of young children and teenagers. Folklórico groups perform for community events, Cinco de Mayo festivals, school functions, Fiestas Guadalupanas (celebrations of La Virgen de Guadalupe, December 12), political events, and other holidays. Ballet folklórico dances are now taught in many schools, and students entering college often bring with them a knowledge of the dances and an interest in participating. Several university campuses in California and the Southwest have dance groups totally comprised by and maintained by college students.

“La Bamba”
The title of a song, as well as the title of a movie directed by Luis Valdez in 1987. The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens, who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958. The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history; it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City. There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California.
“La Bamba” is considered to be a son jarocho (country folks’ dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong African influences, from the state of Veracruz. The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp, a small eight-string guitar (jarana), and a small four-string guitar (requinto). The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado, a foot-stomping dance. There are two different accounts about how Ritchie Valens learned the song, since he supposedly never learned Spanish. One source states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into Mexico, and another states he learned the song from his uncle when he was five years old. His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock ‘n roll beat. His recorded version of “La Bamba” in 1958 is the first known U.S. recording. “La Bamba” has now been recorded more than 150 different times in the United States; for example, in 1966 by Trini Lopez, in 1979 by the Plugz, and in 1980 by Los Lobos. The Rice University Marching Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have also recorded it. The movie, with the soundtrack recorded by Los Lobos, was very successful with mainstream audiences and launched the acting careers of several Latino actors.

Barbacoa de Cabeza (Barbecued Beef Head)
Barbacoa refers to a method of cooking meat, in a pit of hot wood coals. The English word barbecue comes from barbacoa. Barbacoa de cabeza is the cooking of a beef head in this manner. It is an old custom and cultural event that in parts of south Texas occurs every weekend, with the barbacoa eaten on Sunday mornings. In other parts of the Southwest this style of cooking is reserved for special events such as weddings, funerals, and large family gatherings. According to the Diccionario de Mejicanismos (Dictionary of Mexicanisms), barbacoa is “carne asada en un hoyo que se abre en tierra, y se calienta como los hornos” (grilled meat cooked in a hole in the ground heated like an oven). Cooking the beef head with this method means all the parts can be eaten, such as the brains, eyes, tongue, lips, literally everything. Although originally a discarded part of the cow, now it is considered a delicacy and is prepared and sold in many neighborhood stores and restaurants along the Rio Grande border region. Today the term barbacoa is used only to mean the cooking of meat in a pit, also called pit cooking.

Barrio (Neighborhood)
A barrio is a neighborhood, a city district, or a ward in an urban area where Mexicans and Chicanos live. In the early 1900s, Mexican communities were called colonias, as they are in Mexico today, but at some point after World War II, Chicano neighborhoods became known as barrios. In Chicano culture, barrios are identified by given names that in some way describe a characteristic of the neighborhood or reflect its history. Some barrios are only a few blocks, whereas others encompass large urban areas. Some of the oldest barrios can be found in major cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago, El Paso, and San Antonio. In San Fernando, also known as San Fer, two very early barrios were La Rana and El Bajillo (The Frog; The Little Low One). Hoyo Marvilla, another well-known barrio in East Los Angeles, was famous because it was where farmworkers lived and was extremely poor. Barrios are sometimes called ghettos; even though there are very negative and sometimes few positive attributes to living in barrios, they can’t always be presumed to be ghettos in the sense of places where a group is forced to live against its will. Vigil’s work on gang culture explains the allegiance felt by gang members toward their barrio. Mary Helen Ponce writes in Hoyt Street about the barrio where she grew up in Pacoima, California, during the 1940s and 1950s. Many Chicano novelists have set their stories in the barrios of the Southwest and Midwest. Raúl Salinas, in his poem “A Trip through the Mind Jail,” writes about his barrio, and all barrios, while he serves time in prison. In one section of his poem he affirms the positive role of the barrio:
LA LOMA . . . AUSTIN . . . MI BARRIO . . .
I bear you no grudge
I needed you then . . . identity . . . a sense of belonging.
I need you now.
So essential to adult days of imprisonment,
You keep me away from INSANITY’S hungry jaws;
Smiling/Laughing/Crying.
I respect your having been:
my Loma of Austin
my Rose Hill of Los Angeles
my West Side of San Antonio
my Quinto of Houston
my Jackson of San Jose
my Segundo of El Paso
my Barelas of Albuquerque
my Westside of Denver
Flats, Los Marcos, Maravilla, Calle Guadalupe, Magnolia,
Buena Vista, Mateo, La Seis, Chiquis, El Sur and all
Chicano neighborhoods that now exist and once
existed; somewhere, someone remembers

Barriology
The social science of barriology was conceived of as a discipline of study in the pages of Con Safos magazine in 1969. Con Safos: Reflections of Life in the Barrio was one of the early Chicano periodicals published by college students; it printed humorous, political, and literary articles. It is an example of a publication where Chicanos could express cultural and political satire. Barriology was created as a spoof on the academic social sciences; it involved testing those Chicanos not so fluent in the traditions and rituals of living in Chicano neighborhoods or barrios. Con Safos carried monthly examinations developed by Antonio Gómez, “PhD, Barriologist Emeritus.” It was also a way of gently poking fun at Chicano culture, reminding the readers of the uniqueness of the Chicano culture. Some of the exam questions consisted of multiple-choice answers; others required the reader to fill in the answer. Some sample questions follow:
Menudo is made from tripe, which is:
a. the cow’s stomach, b. the cow’s flank, c. horse meat, d. mutton
Someone who is described as a lechusa is a:
a. lettuce peddler, b. leach, c. milkman, d. night person
Capirotada is the traditional food during what time of year? 

Complete the following children’s chant:
Pelon Pelonete, Cabeza de quete, Vendiendo Tamales, (De cinco y de siete.)
Everyone knows that Juan Charrasquiado’s death was caused by
———————. (title and character from a corrido who was killed in a -cantina).
Each exam included a rating scale so that those who took the exam could determine their level of knowledge of the Chicano culture. For example a score of 23 to 28 indicated a Chicano Barriologist was “muy de aquellas” (very Chicano); 18 to 22 indicated High Potential, “o ya casi” (almost a Chicano); 13 to 17 was half Mexican, half American, or “keep trying, you”; 8 to 12 was a “vendido” (sellout or culturally deprived); and 0 to 7 was a “pendejo” (dummy, jerk).

Bato (Dude)
Bato is a word centuries old that can be translated as “guy” or “dude.” Most recently it has been spelled vato, transposing the v for the b. In Chicano communities, in-group chatter, and published literature one frequently comes across the expression bato loco, meaning a “crazy guy,” a “cool dude,” or a “wise guy.” Bato was a word incorporated into the pachuco jargon of the 1940s, and it is still very much a part of Chicano vocabulary today. The bato loco, or vato loco, is the descendent of the pachuco and a close relation of today’s cholo (urban youth). The bato is often mentioned in connection with his barrio, as in el vato loco del Hoyo Mara.
The bato loco is tantamount to an archetype in Chicano culture; he is that crazy guy who isn’t afraid of life. He may be a gang member, a drug user, or just an entertaining street person. He could also be fully immersed in la vida loca as described by Luis Rodriguez in his book, Always Running, and by Oscar Zeta Acosta in The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo. In the novel The Road to Tamazunchale, Ron Arias creates a streetwise character, a bato named Mario, who acts as a sidekick to the main character, Fausto. The two wander through a mythical Los Angeles in search of “the song of life.” For the contemporary Chicano male, el bato loco is not only a symbol of ethnic identity but also an icon of the urban coming-of-age experience itself.
In standard Spanish, bato means “simpleton” or “foolish fellow,” and it has been in use in rural areas of New Mexico since the seventeenth century. In Los Pastores, or the Shepherds’ Play, a mystery play performed in Mexico and the Southwest since the sixteenth century, the shepherd who plays the role of a buffoon, a jester, is named Bato.
Another good example of the life of a bato loco is “La Vida de un Bato Loco,” a short memoir written by an informant of Linda Katz, reproduced in her thesis on the pachuco language and culture written for a master’s degree at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Bolillos (Bread Rolls)
A bolillo is a small loaf of white bread or a large dinner roll, which in the United States is sometimes called French bread. Bolillos, also known as birotes, can be found in most Mexican and Mexican American bakeries and are often served in Mexican restaurants. The folkloric use of bolillo occurs when it is derogatorily applied to Anglo Americans, supposedly because they are as white as bread, and because the Americans invaded and annexed Mexican territory, the Southwest. Although not as popularly known, it carries the same meaning as gringo or gavacho. Chicanos also often use the term, as they do agringado, to describe an overly acculturated Chicano, one who is trying to be “white.”
It is believed the word was originally used to describe French soldiers when they occupied Mexico in the 1860s. Although written references to its use in this way have not been found, there are references to the French eating small loaves of white bread in corridos. Américo Paredes cites a stanza from a corrido (ballad) the Mexican soldiers sang after the Battle of Puebla (celebrated on Cinco de Mayo) that taunts the vanquished French soldiers with the following words:

Qu’es de las piezas de pan?
Aguárdenlas que ahi’ les van. Pam!
(Where are the loaves of bread?
Get ready, for here they go. Bang!)
(1993a, 37)

Bourke, Captain John Gregory (1846–1896)
An early writer of Chicano folk culture and folklore from the Texas-Mexican border. Although Bourke was first and foremost a military man, he became interested in ethnology and anthropology and wrote extensively on these subjects. Born in 1846 to Irish Catholic parents in Pennsylvania, he enlisted in the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry during the Civil War. In 1865 he attended West Point, graduating in 1869 with a commission in the Third Cavalry. He served with General George Crook from 1871 to 1886, and in 1891 wrote a well-received book titled On the Border with Crook.
Through his friendship with the director of the Bureau of American Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution, Bourke studied anthropology and broadened his interests to include ethnology and folklore. At various times he wrote pamphlets for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He gained fame as an Indian fighter, but was also known as an anthropologist and writer. Although primarily a military man, he managed to conduct fieldwork among several -Indian tribes, and was considered an expert on the Apaches. He was stationed along the Rio Grande for two years, during the era of the Catarino Garza revolt, and his diaries from this period are a valuable resource on the Garza movement. He learned the Spanish language, apparently because of his ethnological interests, and wrote on the Tejano and Mexicano culture of the border region. During the 1890s he published ethnographic articles about the Texas-Mexican border in the Journal of American Folklore and the American Anthropologist. Bourke observed, chronicled, and wrote both as a journalist and anthropologist about the folk medicine practices and the folk foodways of the Rio Grande region.
His approach to folklore study was that of the established tradition of the times, which examined current customs, traditions, folkways, and folk narratives as survivals of an earlier civilization. Sometimes this survivalist perspective carried with it an attitude about the prior culture, where the customs originated, as having been a higher civilization. Accordingly, when Bourke became interested in Mexican customs and language, he approached them as the cultural remains of a higher Spanish-Arabic civilization. In spite of the fact that his nineteenth-century biases are very apparent in his writings, the data he collected are valuable for the study of Chicano folklore of the Texas-Mexican border. He was elected president of the American Folklore Society in 1895, and he died in 1896. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Braceros (Laborers)
Mexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program, which was in effect from 1942 to 1964. The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo (arm), which is used, as English uses “hand,” to mean “laborer.” In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands, a laborer, and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers. There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II, and this program offered an answer to that problem, although some braceros also worked on the railroad. Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker, and is often used interchangeably with words like “wetback” or “greaser.” The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4,180 in 1942 to a high of 62,091 in 1944. It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220,000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program. It continued even after the war, and between 1955 and 1959 over 480,000 braceros were still working in the United States. Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain. Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from la migra, the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed, never returning to Mexico. The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaquín, the revolutionary figure of Joaquín Murrieta, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of Dr. Paredes, the gentle leadership of César Chávez; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. Many corridos (ballads) describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest. Maria Herrera-Sobek -describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book The Bracero Experience. In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero, by Jesus Amaya Topete, published in 1949 and reprinted several times, and in the United States the novel Macho! by Edmund Villaseñor, published in 1973.

Brujería (Witchcraft)
Witches and brujería (witchcraft) are accepted facts of life in Mexican and Chicano culture. Belief in witches and witchcraft is common in the Southwest, as can be seen by the large number of folk narratives and legends about witches collected in New Mexico and Texas in the last century. This form of occultism is an integral part of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest. The Spanish conquerors and colonists who settled New Mexico in the sixteenth century communicated to the indigenous communities a belief in witchcraft. Beliefs in witchcraft were prevalent in Europe during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, and the missionary friars brought these beliefs to the New World. The Spanish Catholic missionaries worked hard to convert the indigenous populations of New Spain, and any non-Christian belief that was not acceptable to the Spanish friars was often attributed to sin, evil, the devil, or witchcraft. Consequently it was easy to assign unexplainable natural phenomena to the work of witches, and these beliefs have persisted over hundreds of years. Contemporary witches can prepare love potions, lift spells, cure and cause illnesses, and in general cause great harm. They can also take on any form they desire, such as a cat, pig, or owl, and so can make themselves difficult to identify. In folktales from New Mexico, they often appear as balls of fire flying across the sky. Curanderas are sometimes mistaken for witches because of their healing power, but they are also often called upon to undo the work of witches.
Many of the folktales, legends, and cuentos (stories) collected in New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa, Juan Bautista Rael, and R. D. Jameson (Robe 1980) are about witches and witchcraft. In the 1930s, writers employed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as part of Roosevelt’s New Deal collected many cuentos and legends about witches from the people of northern New Mexico, and many beliefs expressed then are still held today. For instance, the way to tell if a person is a witch is to stick two needles in the form of a cross into the sill above a door; if the person in the room is a witch, she won’t be able to leave the room. Another belief is that only men named Juan or Juan Bautista or women named Juana have the ability to catch or overpower a witch. Conversely the power of a witch cannot be exerted over a person named Juan or Juana. A witch cannot sense the presence of a Juan, so he may be able to trap her by drawing a circle on the ground and throwing his shirt, turned inside out, into the circle.
Witches often take the form of an owl, in New Mexican Spanish called a tecolote, from the Nahuatl word teolotl. The hoot of an owl is an evil omen, so one must be careful to stay away from owls. In other parts of the Southwest owls are sometimes known as lechuzas. A lechuza is a woman who has sold her soul to the devil and becomes an owl by night. Only a woman can become a lechuza.
A prayer meant to keep witches away was recited at night in a low voice:
Cuatro esquinas tiene me casa
Cuatro ángeles que la adoran
Lucas, Marcos, Juan y Mateo
Ni brujas ni hechiceras
Ni hombre malhechor
En el nombre del Padre,
Y del Hijo y del Espiritu Santo.
(My house has four corners
Four angels adore it
Luke, Mark, John and Matthew
Neither witches nor charmers
Nor evil-doing man
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.)
(Simmons 1974a, 11)
Besides being present in folktales and legends, the world of brujas seeps into discussions of love and lovers, literature, and other forms of Chicano folklore and culture.

Burritos
Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla, filled with meat, rice, frijoles (beans), and chile, then folded and rolled up. There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico, tacos de frijoles, or bean burritos, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (cowboys), so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaquero’s horse.
Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs. Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries. Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical. Since corn tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. A burrito can be made with any type of filling, such as beans, potatoes, chile con carne, chile colorado, carnitas (chile with meat, red chile, roasted pork meat), or even peanut butter.
Flour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest, but are not known in other parts of Mexico. Since at least the 1920s, Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos. Originally they were called tacos; another story about the origin of the name is that in the 1940s there was an establishment in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina (flour tortillas). It became a well-known place to go, and people spoke of going a los burritos (to the burritos) when they wanted tacos of that kind. Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in 1961, according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and now there are supposedly over 150 burrito taquerías (taco restaurants) in the Mission District of that city. Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos, in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameter.
